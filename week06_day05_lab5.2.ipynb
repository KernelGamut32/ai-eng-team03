    "\n",
    "**Estimated duration:** ~240 minutes (4 hours)  \n",
    "**Theme:** Design and implement an *end-to-end* evaluation strategy for a small LLM-backed application in a **retail home improvement** domain using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional metrics: **accuracy, F1, BLEU, ROUGE**\n",
    "- An **evaluation harness** that runs your model over a labeled test set\n",
    "- **MLflow** for experiment tracking (metrics, params, artifacts)\n",
    "- **TruLens** for structured LLM evaluation (groundedness, answer relevance, context relevance)\n",
    "- A local LLM running in **LM Studio** (OpenAI-compatible API)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a synthetic **HomePro**-style corpus (~500 docs) with realistic variation.  \n",
    "2. Define an **evaluation dataset** for at least one of:\n",
    "   - FAQ answerer (RAG-style Q&A)  \n",
    "   - Summarizer (summarize product/policy docs)  \n",
    "   - Sentiment classifier (label customer reviews)  \n",
    "3. Implement a simple **RAG-style LLM app** over that corpus using LM Studio.  \n",
    "4. Build a **metric harness** to compute accuracy/F1 (for classification), BLEU, and ROUGE.  \n",
    "5. Track **two variants** of your app with MLflow and compare them.  \n",
    "6. Instrument your app with **TruLens** and compute structured LLM metrics:\n",
    "   - Groundedness (faithfulness)\n",
    "   - Answer relevance\n",
    "   - Context relevance  \n",
    "7. Combine **MLflow** + **TruLens** outputs to argue which variant is “better” and why.\n"
